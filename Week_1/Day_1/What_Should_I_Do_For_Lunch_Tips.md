### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant(Or for you M1 Mac users, the lighthouse directory is fine).

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log('hungry is', hungry);
  console.log('availableTime is' availableTime);
}
```
